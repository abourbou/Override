#first we can see our program take 2 arguments
login and serial

#then it go to auth function
the function does 3 tests:
- 1st test if the login length > 5
- 2nd test if the program is traced (with gdb)
- 3th pass login in a loop and compare with the serial argument

=> we create a login with 6 char : "aaaaaa"
=> we used a program who reproduce the loop : strange_operation.c with the string "aaaaaa"
=> the program final value is 6232801

#we just need to use login : "aaaaaa" with serial : 6232801 and it opens a shell
